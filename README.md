# v12-music-app

## Overview

This project is a Spotify data visualization app that retrieves user listening data and presents it through interactive charts and lists. It allows you to search Spotify to find songs and artists and has a built in player component. The UI adapts to both light and dark mode for an enhanced user experience.

## Changes
I have focused on making this application as accessible as possible by adding clear interactivity, a light and dark mode, title attributes, and a user data page

the changes I have made from the group project include: 
  - dark and light theme (with local storage to save the theme when the page reloads)
  - hover effect on all interactive components
  - User Data page where graphs are displayed showing the user's device usage and genre preferences
  - changed the layout of the Artist page to a list so it is more similar to the home page
  - made the whole application responsive
  - added the title attribute to the logo element and the theme button to make it clear to the user what purpose they serve

Features

ðŸŽµ Top Genres Chart: Displays the most frequently listened-to genres based on the user's top artists.

ðŸ“± Device Usage Chart: Shows the distribution of devices used for Spotify playback.

ðŸŽ§ Podcast vs. Song Chart: Visualizes the ratio of songs to podcasts in the user's listening history.

ðŸŒ— Dark Mode Support: Automatically adjusts the theme based on user preference.

### Customization

Changing Theme Colors

Update the colors in Tailwind configuration or directly modify the classes used in components:

### Modifying API Requests

Adjust the limit values in API requests inside UserData.tsx to retrieve more or fewer results:

const artistResponse = await axios.get<{ items: Artist[] }>(
  "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists?limit=10",
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` } }
);

### Future Enhancements

  - Add more interactive chart types.
  - Add colour theme for different types of colour blindness
  - Include historical trend analysis.


### Home Page
Once a user has signed-in they are taken to the Home Page where two lists appear 'Top Artists' & 'Top Tracks'

### Top Artists
This shows a list of the users top artists which they can scroll through, and click on the artist to take them to the Artist Page.
UI/UX includes responsiveness, cursor-pointer, and a hover effect

### Top Tracks
This shows a list of the users top songs which they can scroll through, and click on the song to take them to the Spotify App or browser page to play the song.
UI/UX includes responsiveness, cursor-pointer, and a hover effect

### Styling
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Consistent color scheme with custom colors
  - Theme toggle so you can go between a colourful theme and a black/white/grey theme
  - Responsive design with flexible layouts

### Interactivity and Useability
  - everything that can be interacted with has a hover effect or some kind of visual indicator
  - the logo and the theme toggle both use the 'title' attribute so a use can hover over the element and read a message stating the function of that element
